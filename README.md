## My Personal Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a showcase of my skills, education, professional interests, and a selection of the projects I've worked on. The goal was to create a clean, responsive, and easy-to-navigate site that effectively communicates who I am as a developer.

## About the Project
This website is a single-page application built primarily with front-end technologies. I focused on creating a modern and engaging user experience. The design is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktops.

## Features
1. About Me: A brief introduction to myself, Nicholas Tunje, as a web developer. I've included a short bio to provide some background on     my passion for technology and my career aspirations.

2. Education: A detailed summary of my academic and professional training, including my current pursuits at Zetech University for a          Bachelor's in Computer Science and a scholarship at PLP Academy.

3. Skills: A visual representation of my proficiency in key web technologies:
    ## HTML: My foundational language for structuring web content.
    ## CSS: The styling language I use to bring designs to life, including responsive layouts and animations.

4. Interests: A section highlighting my professional curiosity and areas of focus, such as Web Development, UI/UX Design, and a              commitment to Continuous Learning.

5. Projects: A spotlight on two of my key projects:
    I). E-Commerce Dashboard: A responsive admin dashboard for managing analytics and inventory. It was built using React, Node.js,                MongoDB, and Chart.js.
    II). Personal Finance Tracker: A cross-platform mobile application designed to help users manage expenses. The tech stack for this             includes React Native, Firebase, Redux, and ML Kit.

6. Contact Me: A straightforward way for visitors to get in touch with me. This section includes a contact form as well as my personal       contact details and links to my social media profiles.

## Technologies Used
I built this portfolio using a combination of standard web development tools:
  I).  HTML: To structure the content of the entire website.
  II). CSS: To handle all the styling, including the color scheme, typography, layout, and responsive design. I used CSS custom                  properties (variables) to maintain consistency and make the design easy to manage.
